=== New features and enhancements

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2141-new-ca_{context}"]
==== Support for the Cron trigger with the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator

The Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator can now use the Cron trigger to scale pods based on an hourly schedule. When your specified time frame starts, the Custom Metrics Autoscaler Operator scales pods to your desired amount. When the time frame ends, the Operator scales back down to the previous level.

For more information, see xref:../../../nodes/cma/nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger.adoc#nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger-cron_nodes-cma-autoscaling-custom-trigger[Understanding the Cron trigger].

[id="nodes-pods-autoscaling-custom-rn-2141-bugs_{context}"]
=== Bug fixes

* Previously, if you made changes to audit configuration parameters in the `KedaController` custom resource, the `keda-metrics-server-audit-policy` config map would not get updated. As a consequence, you could not change the audit configuration parameters after the initial deployment of the Custom Metrics Autoscaler. With this fix, changes to the audit configuration now render properly in the config map, allowing you to change the audit configuration any time after installation. (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-32521[*OCPBUGS-32521*])

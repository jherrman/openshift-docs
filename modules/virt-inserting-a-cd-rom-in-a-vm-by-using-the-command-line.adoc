[id="virt-inserting-a-cd-rom-in-a-vm-by-using-the-command-line_{context}"]
= Inserting a CD-ROM in a VM by using the command line

[role="_abstract"]
To make data on a CD-ROM storage device available to a virtual machine (VM) in {product-title}, create a virtual CD-ROM drive in the VM and insert the CD-ROM into the drive as an ISO image.

Setting up a virtual CD-ROM drive requires rebooting the VM, but you can insert and eject ISO images in the drive while the VM is running.
// See https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/storage/hotplug_volumes/#inject-cd-rom for upstream info

[IMPORTANT]
====
 CD-ROMs are currently provided as a Technology Preview in {product-title}. For more information, see link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/?extIdCarryOver=true&sc_cid=RHCTG0180000371695[Technology Preview features - Scope of Support] in Red Hat Knowledgebase.

.Prerequisites

* The `DeclarativeHotplugVolumes` feature gate must be enabled. To ensure this, the `HyperConverged` CR must contain the `declarativeHotplugVolumes: true` line in the `spec.featureGates` configuration section:

+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
    featureGates:
      declarativeHotplugVolumes: true
----
+
[Warning]
====
The `DeclarativeHotplugVolumes` feature gate is incompatible with the `HotplugVolumes` feature gate, which is required for using ephemeral volumes. To use `DeclarativeHotplugVolumes`, you must also disable `HotplugVolumes` in the `HyperConverged` CR.
====

* You have an ISO image of a CD-ROM available in the cluster.

.Procedure

. Open the configuration of the VM in which you want to insert the CD-ROM:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc edit _<vm-name>_ _<namespace>_
----
+
where:

* _<vm-name>_ is the name of the VM
* _<project>_ is the name of the project name space that contains the VM

. Add a `cdrom` disk to the `spec.template.spec.domains.devices.disks` section of the configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  runStrategy: Always
  template:
    spec:
      domain:
        devices:
          disks:
          - cdrom:
              bus: sata
              name: cdrom
# ...
----

. If the VM is running, shut it down.

. Insert a CD-ROM volume in the `spec.template.spec.volumes` section of the configuration, for example as follows:
+
[source,yaml]
----
      volumes:
      - dataVolume:
          name: cdrom-example
          hotpluggable: true
        name: cdrom
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also do this when the VM is running.
====

. Optional: Eject the CD-ROM volume. To do so, remove the `cdrom` device from the `spec.template.spec.volumes` section of the VM configuration. You can also do this when the VM is running.
